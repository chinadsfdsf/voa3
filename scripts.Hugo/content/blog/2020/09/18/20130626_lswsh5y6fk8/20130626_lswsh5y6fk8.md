info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English. In the congressional elections of eighteen sixty-six, radicals won firm control of both houses of Congress. They were able to pass a number of bills over the president s veto. But Johnson refused to stand aside in the face of radical attempts to seize all powers of government.  This conflict between Johnson and the Congress caused much bitterness. Finally, the radicals decided to get him out of the way. For the first time in American history, Congress would try to remove the President from office.  Under the United States Constitution, the House of Representatives has the power to bring charges against the president. The Senate acts as the jury to decide if the president is guilty of the charges. The chief justice of the United States serves as judge.  If two-thirds of the senators find the president guilty, he can be removed from office.  Radicals in the House of Representatives brought eleven charges against President Johnson.  Most of the charges were based on Johnson s removal from office of his secretary of war. Radicals charged that this violated a new law. The law said the president could not remove a cabinet officer without approval by the Senate.  Johnson refused to recognize the law. He said it was not constitutional.  Radicals in the House of Representatives also charged Johnson with criticizing Congress. They said his statements dishonored Congress and the presidency.  The great impeachment trial began on March fifth, eighteen sixty-eight. The president refused to attend. But his lawyers were there to defend him.   The trial went on day after day. The decision would be close. Fifty-four senators would be voting. Thirty-six votes of guilty were needed to remove the president from office.  It soon became clear that the radicals had thirty-five of these votes. Only seven senators remained undecided. If one of the seven voted guilty, Johnson would be removed.  Radicals put great pressure on the seven men. They tried to buy their votes. Party leaders threatened them. Supporters in the senators  home states were told to write hundreds of letters demanding that Johnson be found guilty.  A senator from Maine was one who felt the pressure. But he refused to let it force him to do what others wished. He answered one letter this    Sir, I wish you and all my other friends to know that I, not they, am sitting in judgment upon the president. I, not they, have sworn to do impartial justice. I, not they, am responsible to God and man for my action and its results.   A senator from Kansas was another who refused to let pressure decide his vote. He said,  I trust that I shall have the courage to vote as I judge best.   In the final days before the vote, six of the seven remaining Republican senators let it be known that they would vote not guilty. But the senator from Kansas still refused to say what his vote would be. His was the only vote still in question. His vote would decide the issue.  Now, the pressure on him increased. His brother was offered twenty thousand dollars for information about how the senator would vote. Everywhere he turned, he found someone demanding that he vote guilty.  The vote took place on May sixteenth. Every seat in the big Senate room was filled. The chief justice began to call on the senators. One by one, they answered guilty or not guilty. Finally, he called the name of the senator from Kansas.  The senator stood up. He looked about him. Every voice was still. Every eye was upon him.   It was like looking down into an open grave,  he said later.  Friendship, position, wealth -- everything that makes life desirable to an ambitious man -- were about to be swept away by my answer.   He spoke softly. Many could not hear him. The chief justice asked him to repeat his vote. This time, the answer was clearly heard across the    Not guilty.   The trial was all but done. Remaining senators voted as expected. The chief justice announced the result. On the first charge, thirty-five senators voted that President Johnson was guilty. Nineteen voted that he was not guilty. The radicals had failed by one vote.  When the Senate voted on the other charges, the result was the same. The radicals could not get the two-thirds majority they needed. President Johnson was declared not guilty. "
