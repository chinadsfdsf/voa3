info2 : "Welcome to THE MAKING OF A NATION -- American history in VOA Special English.  On April ninth, eighteen sixty-five, Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered his army to Union General Ulysses Grant. Within weeks, the Civil War would be over.  When people in Washington learned of Lee s surrender, they hurried to the White House. The crowd wanted to hear from President Abraham Lincoln.  The speech he gave would be one of his last, as Kay Gallant and Harry Monroe explain this week in our series.    President Lincoln spoke several days after General Lee s surrender. The people expected a victory speech. But Lincoln gave them something else.  Already, he was moving forward from victory to the difficult times ahead. The southern rebellion was over. Now, he faced the task of re-building the Union. Lincoln did not want to punish the South. He wanted to re-join the ties that the Civil War had broken. So, when the people of the North expected a speech of victory, he gave them a speech of reconstruction, instead.  On the night of April eleventh, Lincoln appeared before a crowd outside the White House. He held a candle in one hand and his speech in the other.    Fellow citizens,  Lincoln said.  We meet this evening not in sorrow, but in gladness of heart. The surrender of the main army of the Confederacy gives hope of a righteous and speedy peace. The joy cannot be held back. By these recent successes, we have had pressed more closely upon us the question of reconstruction.   We all agree,  Lincoln continued,  that the so-called seceded states are out of their correct relation with the Union. We also agree that what the government is trying to do is get these states back into their correct relation.   I believe it is not only possible, but in fact easier to do this without deciding the legal question of whether these states have ever been out of the Union. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be of no importance whether they had ever been away.    The president continued to discuss his ideas on reconstruction over the next few days. On Friday, April fourteenth, he agreed to put this work aside for a while.  In the afternoon, he took his wife Mary for a long drive away from the city. In the evening, they would go to the theater.   The President and Misses Lincoln sat in special seats at Ford s Theatre. The presidential box was above and to one side of the stage. A guard always stood outside the door to the box. On this night, however, the guard did not remain. He left the box unprotected.    President Lincoln settled down in his seat to enjoy the play. As he did so, a man came to the door of the box. He carried a gun in one hand and a knife in the other. The man entered the presidential box quietly. He slowly raised the gun. He aimed it at the back of Lincoln s head. He fired.  Then the man jumped from the box to the stage three meters below. Many in the theater recognized him. He was an   John Wilkes Booth.  Booth broke his leg when he hit the stage floor. But he pulled himself up, shouted  Sic semper tyrannis!  --  Thus ever to tyrants!  -- and ran out the door. He got on a horse, and was gone.   The attack was so quick that the audience did not know what had happened. Then a woman shouted,  The president has been shot!   Lincoln had fallen forward in his seat, unconscious. Someone asked if it was possible to move him to the White House. A young army doctor said no. The president s wound was terrible. He would die long before reaching the White House.  So Lincoln was moved to a house across the street from Ford s Theatre. A doctor tried to remove the bullet from the president s head. He could not. Nothing could be done, except wait. The end was only hours away.    Cabinet members began to arrive, while wild reports spread through the   the Confederates had declared war again! There was fighting in the streets!   Early the next morning, April fifteenth, Abraham Lincoln died. A prayer was said over his body. His eyes were closed.  The news went out by telegraph to cities and towns across the country. People read the words, but could not believe them. To millions of Americans, Abraham Lincoln s death was a personal loss. They had come to think of him as more than the President of the United States. He was a trusted friend.  People hung black cloth on their doors in sorrow. Even the South mourned for Lincoln, its former enemy. Southern General Joe Johnston    Mr. Lincoln was the best friend we had. His death is the worst thing that could happen for the South.   http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/a-23-2009-12-30-voa3-84658692/115767.html This is a VOA product in the public domain "
