So Missus Lincoln decided that the president s final resting place would be in the quiet, beautiful Oak Ridge Cemetery outside their home town of Springfield, Illinois.    For several days after Lincoln s assassination, his body lay in the East Room of the White House. The room was open to the public all day. Next, the body was taken to the Capitol building. Again, the public could come to say goodbye. Then the body was put on a special train for the trip back to Illinois.   In every town, people lined the railroad. They stood silently, with tears in their eyes, as the train moved slowly past. Farmers working in the fields saw the train and dropped to their knees in prayer. For the wise man who had led the Union through four years of bloody civil war -- Father Abraham -- was dead.  Churches throughout the country held memorial services. Ministers told their people that God had taken Lincoln because the president had completed the job God had given him. He had brought peace to the Union, and freedom to all men.   The final service was at the cemetery outside Springfield. It ended with the words from Lincoln s second inaugural speech.   With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right -- as God gives us to see the right -- let us strive on to finish the work we are in. Let us heal the nation s wounds. Let us do all possible to get and keep a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.     While the nation mourned Lincoln s death, federal officials investigated his assassination. The man who had shot Lincoln in Ford s Theater was an actor, John Wilkes Booth. He had fled the theater after the murder. The government offered a reward of one hundred thousand dollars to anyone who captured Booth and his helpers.   John Wilkes Booth and David Herold ran and hid for six days. They crossed the Potomac River from Maryland into Virginia. Finally, twelve days after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, soldiers found the two men. They were hiding in a tobacco barn near the town of Port Royal.  Herold agreed to surrender. He came out of the barn with his hands in the air. He shouted again and again that he was innocent.  Booth refused to come out. The soldiers set fire to the barn.   The fire forced Booth to move close to the door. The soldiers could see him now. He was aiming a gun at them. The soldiers had been ordered to capture Booth alive. But one of them raised his gun and shot Booth in the neck.  The actor fell. Some of the soldiers ran to the burning barn and pulled him out. They carried him to a nearby house. He died two hours later.   John Wilkes Booth carried a notebook. He wrote in it every day. On the day Lincoln was killed, he    For six months we had worked to kidnap Lincoln. But with the Confederacy being almost lost, something decisive and great must be done. I struck boldly.   Booth described how and why he had shot the president.  Our country,  Booth wrote,  owed all her troubles to him. And God simply made me the instrument of his punishment.   Booth s body was returned to Washington. Men who knew him confirmed that it was the body of John Wilkes Booth. The body was buried under the stone floor of the Washington prison. A few years later, his family received permission to move the body to a cemetery in the city of Baltimore. The secretary of war announced that the prisoners could not meet privately with their defense lawyers. They could meet only in the courtroom. Guards could hear everything they said.  One of the defense lawyers recognized that the job was hopeless. He said the trial was a contest between the defense lawyers and the whole United States. There was no question, he said, what the military court s decision would be. Four hundred witnesses appeared. Many of the important ones had been arrested as suspects. They agreed to give evidence if the government dropped the charges against them.  For six weeks, the court heard evidence against the eight prisoners. The prisoners themselves could say nothing. They could only listen.    In late June, eighteen sixty-five, the trial of Abraham Lincoln s assassins ended. The military officers serving as judges met secretly for two days. Then they announced their decision.  All eight prisoners were found guilty. One received a prison sentence of six years. Three were sentenced to life in prison. Four were sentenced to die.  Defense lawyers appealed for mercy. The appeal was rejected. On July seventh, David Herold, Lewis Paine, George Atzerodt and Mary Surratt were hanged for the murder of Abraham Lincoln.    http://learningenglish.voanews.com/content/a-23-2010-01-06-voa3-84659647/115811.html This is a VOA product in the public domain "
